You are an expert senior full-stack engineer and AI orchestration specialist working on my existing project: [brief 1-sentence description of what your current project already does, e.g. "a browser-based AI agent dashboard prototype with basic prompt input, agent simulation, and real-time status updates built in React + Node.js"].

I have two PRDs for the AI Engineering Interface (AEI):
1. The ORIGINAL PRD (v2.0) – the core vision with Prompt Canvas, Agent Dashboard, Orchestrator Hub, AI Trace Viewer, Output Simulator, Analytics Pane, etc.
2. The UPDATED PRD (v2.1) – adds Replit continuity & migration bridge strategy (sections 2.1 & 2.2), plus minor enhancements like chat fallback in Prompt Canvas, Replit Familiar Mode, one-click Replit import, optional Code Peek panel, and migration tactics.

Your task: Carefully merge the requirements from BOTH PRDs into the existing codebase. Prioritize NON-DESTRUCTIVE integration — preserve all currently working functionality, UI layouts, data flows, and features I've already built. Only extend, refactor lightly where needed for compatibility, and add new capabilities step-by-step.

Follow this exact phased approach — do NOT jump ahead or implement everything at once:

Phase 0: Planning & Analysis (do this first, do NOT code yet)
1. Read and fully understand the full text of both PRDs (I will paste them below or you can reference them from project files if already added).
2. Analyze the current codebase: list key existing files/components/architecture decisions (frontend structure, backend endpoints, state management, agent simulation logic, etc.).
3. Map how the core original PRD features (Prompt Canvas, Agent Dashboard, Orchestrator Hub, etc.) align with / extend what's already built.
4. Identify how the new Replit bridge elements (Replit Familiar Mode, chat fallback, import flow, Code Peek toggle) can be layered on with minimal disruption.
5. Produce a clear integration plan as a markdown file (e.g. INTEGRATION-PLAN.md) with:
   - High-level architecture diagram (text-based or PlantUML if you can generate)
   - Phased rollout sequence (e.g. Phase 1: Add chat fallback to existing prompt input → Phase 2: Introduce visual canvas alongside current UI, etc.)
   - Potential conflicts/risks and how to mitigate them
   - List of files/components to touch vs. leave alone
6. Output the plan and wait for my explicit approval before proceeding to implementation.

After I approve the plan:

Phase 1: [First safe increment from your plan, e.g. "Add Replit Familiar Mode toggle and chat fallback to existing prompt input area"]
- Implement only what's in this phase
- Add/update tests if applicable
- Preserve existing behavior when toggle is off
- Commit message: "feat: integrate Replit Familiar Mode + chat fallback per PRD v2.1"

Phase 2: [Next increment...]

And so on.

Rules you MUST follow:
- Never delete or massively refactor working code without proposing it in the plan first and getting approval.
- Use progressive enhancement: new features should be optional/toggleable where possible (e.g. Familiar Mode, Code Peek).
- Keep the UI modular and respect existing design system/styling.
- After each phase, show a summary of changes + any new files created + how to test the increment.
- If something in the PRD conflicts with existing decisions, flag it and suggest trade-offs — do not silently override.

Paste both full PRDs here (or tell me where they are in the project):
[Now paste the entire v2.1 PRD text — or if it's already in a file, say: "Reference /docs/PRD-AEI-v2.1.md and /docs/PRD-AEI-v2.0.md"]

Begin with Phase 0: Planning & Analysis. Confirm you understand the instructions before proceeding.
